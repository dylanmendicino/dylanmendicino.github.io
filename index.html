<h1> <color="blue">Stewart Empire </h1>
<p> The empire of Martha Stewart is one of a kind. Whether it be her own tv show or just the name Stewart, everyone knows who this goddess is. Her cookware alone has made over 20 million dollars in the last year. That is insane considering the fact that she no longer partakes in live cooking shows. </p>

<h2> <color="blue">The Most Beautiful Girl in the World </h2>
<p> 
At the age of 75, she looks 30. Many women are jealous of her flawless skin and bashful personality. She has endorsed skin care products such as Clinque to show her daily skin care routine. Also, Covergirl has made her a spokesperson for their makeup line. She is the oldest Covergirl model, and she will continue to impress us with her angelic presence!

<h3> <color="blue">The Perfect Life </h3>
<p> Her home in Westport, Connecticut is 7,000 square feet on a lot of 5 acres. There she grows vegetables and flowers of many kinds. Her home has been shown on magazines such as Home Goods. Everyone is baffled by her interior design skills. She has a true gift for designing homes.  Martha has actually mentioned making a line of lamps for homes in the future. Many adore her perfect life that entails reading books every morning and Zumba classes by the lake at night. She is the epitome of perfection.  </p>
